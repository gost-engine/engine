A reference implementation of the Russian GOST crypto algorithms for OpenSSL

Compatibility: OpenSSL 1.1.1 (needs patches)
*This branch should not compile with vanilla OpenSSL 1.1.1!
It requires patching OpenSSL using the patches/openssl_111g.diff*

License: same as the corresponding version of OpenSSL.
